## BigData

Note this our mongodb is localhost on port 27017 so the query will work only in our localhost!

we create a mongodb with the file 'movie_titles.csv' with db name 'NetflixMovies' on collection 'movies'.

but in file 'server.js' you can see the code for create the server and the connection to mongodb + the query!.

we use the 'ejs' approch to update the webform, the file is in '/views/index.ejs'.

1) to run the server you should run on terminal:

   'cd /BigData'
	
   'node server.js'

2) go to your browser and enter:

   '127.0.0.1:8080'

3) search for your movies by Name or Year!

Thank for using our service.
